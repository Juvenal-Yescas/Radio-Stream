    <dt>Source client</dt>
    <dd>A source client is an external program which is responsible for sending content data to Icecast.<br />
Some source clients that support Icecast 2 are Oddcast, Ices 2, Ices 0.3 and DarkIce.</dd>
    <dt>Slave server (Relay)</dt>
    <dd>The slave server in a relay configuration is the server that is pulling the data from the master server.
It acts as a listening client to the master server.</dd>
    <dt>Master server (Relay)</dt>
    <dd>The master server in a relay configuration is the server that has the stream that is being relayed.</dd>
    <dt>Mountpoint</dt>
    <dd>A mountpoint is a resource on the Icecast server that represents a single broadcast stream. Mountpoints are
named similar to files (<code>/mystream.ogg</code>, <code>/mymp3stream</code>).<br />
When listeners connect to Icecast, they must specify the mountpoint in the request (i.e. <code>http://192.168.1.10:8000/mystream.ogg</code>).
Additionally, source clients must specify a mountpoint when they connect as well. Statistics are kept track of by mountpoint.
Mountpoints are a fundamental aspect of Icecast 2 and how it is organized.</dd>
    <dt>Fallback mountpoint</dt>
    <dd>A fallback mountpoint is configured with a parent mountpoint. In the event of the parent mountpoint losing connection with Icecast,
Icecast will then move all clients currently connected to the now defunct mountpoint to itâ€™s fallback mountpoint.</dd>
